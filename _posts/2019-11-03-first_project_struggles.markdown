When I first started this project, I was worried and honestly intimidated. As time went on more and more of my anxieties disappeared. I realized as I slowly and painfully built my first mess out that I’m not stupid and I am still learning this stuff. It might not be solidified yet but one step at a time. 

I’ve only worked on this project for but between the help of around 8 people and some complete confusion it’s almost done. There’s just one glaring issue holding me back right now but I’ll figure it out soon. My biggest issue involved setting up my scraper. Working through our lessons gave me the basics ideas but left me feeling lackluster when the time came to set up my tools. I still wouldn’t say I’m good at scraping yet but I’m better than I was. It took me about two days to work through several sites and get my basic scraper set up. I suffered major issues during the process such as getting most of what I needed from one set but being unable to find the final bits. Once I finally settled on using PCGAMER I only had one big issue.

I couldn’t figure the issue out on my own so I brought my instructor in on it and she found something that blew us both away. I was trying to pull a link from the articles I was using but everything I used returned extra trash. Eventually she found a way to completely narrow it down using a :not() selector. To sum up it’s function you put what selector you don’t want used when you run the .css selector and it excludes that from what’s displayed. That fixed my biggest stop gap for the project. Now I’m sure there was another way to do that but none that we tried worked and this did so we got it working and moved on. 


Even though my project is not completely finished I’ve learned so much from just building my own tool. Things I struggled with are cemented and now I can focus on my struggles.
